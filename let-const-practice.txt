What is the difference between var and let?

VAR can be redeclared, reassigned, is added to the window object, 
and is function scoped.
LET cannot be redeclared, is not added to the window object, and is block scoped. 
LET and VAR behave the same only in that they both can have their values reassigned.

What is the difference between var and const?

VAR can be redeclared, reassigned, is added to the window object, 
and is function scoped.
CONST cannot be redeclared or reassigned, is not added to the window object, 
and is block scoped. 
VAR and CONST behave the same only in that they both can mutate their values, 
as in, the contents of an array or object can be changed.

What is the difference between let and const?

First, LET can be reassigned, but CONST cannot be reassigned. Second, when 
you declare a variable with LET, you are not required to set an initial value. 
However, when you declare a variable with CONST, you must set an initial value, 
even if it is simply an empty object or an empty array. 

What is hoisting?

HOISTING -> with the VAR keyword, variable declarations are run first, hoisted 
to the global scope, before the variables are assigned values. This doesn't 
happen with LET or CONST.
